# Sport Real-time TRacking, Identification & DEtection, on top of Contanos [STRIDE]

**STRIDE** is a modular, real‑time sports analytics pipeline for detection, tracking and pose estimation. It is **built on top of the Contanos framework** (base classes, I/O conventions, and runtime helpers) but **this repository does not vendor the Contanos code** anymore.

- **In containers**: the base Docker images used by STRIDE fetch and install `contanos-core` automatically.

- **For local debugging (outside Docker)**: clone [`contanos-core`](https://github.com/yyhtbs-yye/contanos-core) and use only the `contanos` folder (or install it as a package). A minimal approach:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yyhtbs-yye/contanos-core
  # Option A: make the package importable
  export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/contanos-core:$PYTHONPATH
  # Option B: symlink just the folder next to your scripts
  ln -s /path/to/contanos-core/contanos ./contanos
  ```

---

## Project Description

STRIDE decomposes a video analytics workload into **independent micro‑services** wired together with **MQTT topics** and **RTSP streams**:

- **Input**: an RTSP source service (or your own camera) publishes frames to the pipeline.
- **Perception**:
  - **YOLOX** (ONNX) for person detection
  - **ByteTrack** for multi‑object tracking
  - **RTMPose** (ONNX) for multi‑person 2D pose estimation
  - Optional modules such as **Jersey OCR** (GPU) and **CMC** (CPU)
- **Visualization**: an annotation/overlay service renders results and republishes an **RTSP output** you can watch in VLC/FFplay.
- **Glue**: an **MQTT broker** (Eclipse Mosquitto) and an **RTSP server** (MediaMTX) coordinate message passing and stream fan‑out.

Each service is a small container that follows the **Contanos base classes and I/O conventions** (e.g., `IN_MQTT_URL_*`, `OUT_MQTT_URL`, `IN_RTSP_URL`, `OUT_RTSP_URL`). This keeps components loosely coupled and easy to swap while enabling low‑latency, real‑time operation.

> Note: Contanos is an external dependency. STRIDE's images install `contanos-core` at build time; the repository itself intentionally excludes the Contanos sources.

## Features

- **End‑to‑end real‑time pipeline**
  - Detection → Tracking → Pose → (optional) OCR/CMC → Annotation/RTSP out
- **Service‑per‑task architecture**
  - Every task runs as its **own container**, enabling independent scaling and failure isolation.
- **Standards‑based I/O**
  - **RTSP** for video in/out (MediaMTX), **MQTT** for structured results/events between stages.
- **GPU‑ready base images**
  - Curated **base images** for ONNX Runtime (GPU), PyTorch (GPU), and OpenCV (CPU).
- **Config via environment variables**
  - Uniform env keys across services (e.g., `IN_MQTT_URL_1`, `OUT_MQTT_URL`, `DEVICES`, `MODEL_INPUT_SIZE`).
- **Local dev without vendoring**
  - Keep your repo clean; for local runs, simply clone **`contanos-core`** and use its `contanos` folder.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose v2**
- For GPU workloads: **NVIDIA driver**, **CUDA‑capable GPU**, and **NVIDIA Container Toolkit** on the host
- (Optional, for local debugging) **Python 3.9+** and a Conda/venv with `requirements.txt`

### 1) Clone this repository

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd sparta-stride-main
```

### 2) Build the base images

The base images are tagged as `contanos:base-opencv-cpu`, `contanos:base-onnx-gpu`, and `contanos:base-pytorch-gpu`. They also **install `contanos-core`** inside the image.

```bash
# from the repository root
bash ./build-base-images.bash
```

> If you prefer manual builds:
>
> ```bash
> docker build stride/base-opencv-cpu   -t contanos:base-opencv-cpu
> docker build stride/base-onnx-gpu     -t contanos:base-onnx-gpu
> docker build stride/base-pytorch-gpu  -t contanos:base-pytorch-gpu
> ```

### 3) (Optional) Local debugging without Docker

If you want to run workers locally, clone Contanos once and make the `contanos` package importable:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yyhtbs-yye/contanos-core
export PYTHONPATH=/absolute/path/to/contanos-core:$PYTHONPATH
# or place/symlink just the `contanos/` folder next to your scripts
```

## Usage

The ready‑to‑run **Docker Compose** file lives in `stride/docker-compose.yml`.

### Quick start (end‑to‑end demo)

```bash
cd stride
docker compose up --build -d
# or selectively:
# docker compose up --build -d mqtt-broker rtsp-server mp4-rtsp-source yolox-service bytetrack-service rtmpose-service annotator-service
```

What you get by default:

- **MQTT broker** at `localhost:1883`
- **RTSP server** (MediaMTX) at `rtsp://localhost:8554/`
- **Input stream** from the `mp4-rtsp-source` service
- **Annotated RTSP output** at **`rtsp://localhost:5108/annotated_stream`**
- **MQTT topics** produced/consumed by services:
  - `yolox`, `bytetrack`, `rtmpose`, `cmc`, `jerseyocr`
  - The annotator subscribes to these and publishes the RTSP overlay.

**Watching the output**: open the annotated stream in VLC/FFplay, e.g.

```bash
ffplay -rtsp_transport tcp rtsp://localhost:5108/annotated_stream
```

### Configuration via environment variables

The compose file wires services using a small set of shared env vars:

- `IN_RTSP_URL` – RTSP input (e.g., `rtsp://localhost:8554,topic=mystream`)

- `OUT_RTSP_URL` – RTSP output (host:port and topic)

- `IN_MQTT_URL_*` – One or more MQTT subscriptions, e.g.

  ```
  mqtt://localhost:1883,topic=yolox,client_id=yolox,qos=2,queue_max_len=100
  ```

- `OUT_MQTT_URL` – Where a service publishes results, same URI style as above

- `DEVICES` – Compute device(s), e.g. `cuda:0` or `cuda:0,cuda:1` (CPU services ignore this)

- `MODEL_INPUT_SIZE` – Optional model‑specific input resolution (e.g., `640,640`)

You can override these on `docker compose` command lines or by editing `stride/docker-compose.yml`.

### Logs & troubleshooting

```bash
docker compose logs -f yolox-service
docker compose ps
docker stats
```

If the annotated stream is empty, ensure the producer topics (`yolox`, `bytetrack`, `rtmpose`) are flowing and the annotator is subscribed.
